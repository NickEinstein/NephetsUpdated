          The International English Language Testing System (IELTS) is an exam
          that is been done on a weekly or bi-weekly basis across different
          countries. Which is designed to help you work, study or migrate to a
          country where English is the native language. This includes countries
          such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and the USA. This exam
          tests your ability, fluency and proficiency to listen, read, write and
          speak in English will be assessed during the test. IELTS is graded on
          a scale of 1-9.

            If you intend to live, school or work in an English-speaking
            country, it is necessary to enroll and write the IELTS exams,
            especially for immigration purposes. In recent times we have seen
            the reduction of IELTS exanimation been a major requirement to
            entering an English-speaking country, especially in the area of
            schooling prior to the fact that the host or applicant country is an
            English-speaking country.
